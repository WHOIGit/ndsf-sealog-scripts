# NDSF Sealog Scripts

This repository contains scripts that customize the data feeds presented by the NDSF Sealog instances used by the ROV *Jason* and HOV *Alvin*.

The scripts were originally developed by the authors of the Sealog project, and have been customized or rewritten for the NDSF vehicles.
